\subsection{Detailed Description}
This file was auto-\/generated by generate-\/includes.\-php and includes all of the core files required by H\-T\-M\-L Purifier. Use this if performance is a primary concern and you are using an opcode cache. P\-L\-E\-A\-S\-E D\-O N\-O\-T E\-D\-I\-T T\-H\-I\-S F\-I\-L\-E, changes will be overwritten the next time the script is run.

\begin{DoxyWarning}{Warning}
You must {\itshape not} include any other H\-T\-M\-L Purifier files before this file, because 'require' not 'require\-\_\-once' is used.

This file requires that the include path contains the H\-T\-M\-L Purifier library directory; this is not auto-\/set.
